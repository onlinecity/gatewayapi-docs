GatewayAPI.com documentation
============================

Our documentation is broken into a few parts based on protocol.
All new customers are encouraged to use the new :ref:`rest`. However we also
provide a few legacy APIs based on SOAP and HTTP POST/GET, which are still
maintained although deprecated.

If you are reading this online at https://gatewayapi.com/docs/ and require any
assistence, please use the live chat feature at the bottom right of your screen.

You can also consult the `HTTP Routing Table <http-routingtable.html>`_

In addition to our dashboard, which you can find on https://gatewayapi.com/app/,
we also offer programmatic access to a few of the functions offered in the
dashboard.
You will find the documentation for these at https://gatewayapi.com/docs/

Writing and improving this documentation is an ongoing effort. Pull requests etc
